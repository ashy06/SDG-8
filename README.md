## Deployment
https://ashy06.github.io/SDG-8

## Project Overview

This project explores aspects of Sustainable Development Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth.  It leverages HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and potentially other libraries (based on the presence of `jquery.js` and `turn.js`) to present information related to SDG 8.  The project includes visual elements (images and charts) and potentially interactive components.

## Features

* **Interactive Presentation:** Uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for an interactive user experience.  The inclusion of `turn.js` suggests the possibility of a page-turning or book-like interface.
* **Visual Data Representation:** Employs charts and images (`chart.jpg`, `chart.png`, etc.) to visualize data related to SDG 8.
* **Supporting Documents:** Includes a PDF document (`SDG-8.pdf`) containing further information or analysis.
* **Image Gallery:** Contains a collection of images related to decent work, economic growth, and potentially specific case studies.
